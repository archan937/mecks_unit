# MecksUnit [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/archan937/mecks_unit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/archan937/mecks_unit)

A simple Elixir package to elegantly mock module functions within (asynchronous) ExUnit tests using Erlang's `:meck` library

## Installation

To install MecksUnit, please do the following:

  1. Add mecks_unit to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

      ```elixir
      def deps do
        [
          {:mecks_unit, "~> 0.1.9", only: :test}
        ]
      end
      ```

## Usage

Mocking module functions is pretty straightforward and done as follows:

  1. Add `use MecksUnit.Case` at the beginning of your test file
  2. Use `defmock` as if you would define the original module with `defmodule` containing mocked functions
  3. Use `mocked_test` as if you would define a normal ExUnit `test` after having defined all the required mock modules
  4. Add `MecksUnit.mock()` in your `test/test_helper.exs` file
  5. Enjoy ;)

Please note that the defined mock modules only apply to the first `mocked_test` encountered.
So they are isolated (despite of `:meck` having an unfortunate global effect) as MecksUnit takes care of it.
Also, non-matching function heads within the mock module will result in invoking the original module function as well.

As of version `0.1.2`, you can assert function calls using `called` (returns a boolean) or `assert_called` (raises an
error when not having found a match) within your test block. Use `_` to match any argument as if you would pattern match.

Prior to version `0.1.3`, you would very often get `:meck` related compile errors when using MecksUnit in multiple test files.
From that version on, this problem is solved. Happy testing! ^^

### Define mock module for entire test case

As of version `0.1.8`, you can "preserve" a mocked module definition for the rest of the test case by adding `preserve: true`.

  ```elixir
  defmock List, preserve: true do
    def wrap(:foo), do: [1, 2, 3, 4]
  end
  ```

This behaviour is intended to be implemented as natural as possible. Therefore, you can override a preserved mock module once
just by inserting a "regular" mock module definition:

  ```elixir
  defmock List, preserve: true do
    def wrap(:foo), do: [1, 2, 3, 4]
  end

  # mocked tests ...

  defmock List do
    def wrap(:foo), do: ["this only applies to the next `mocked_test`"]
  end
  ```

Also, you can override a preserved mock module for the rest of the test case by using `preserve: true` again.

  ```elixir
  defmock List, preserve: true do
    def wrap(:foo), do: [1, 2, 3, 4]
  end

  # mocked tests ...

  defmock List do
    def wrap(:foo), do: ["this only applies to the next `mocked_test`"]
  end

  # mocked tests ...

  defmock List, preserve: true do
    def wrap(:foo), do: [5, 6, 7, 8]
  end
  ```

Please note that this behaviour is also tested in [test/mecks_unit/preserve_test.exs](https://github.com/archan937/mecks_unit/blob/master/test/mecks_unit/preserve_test.exs).

### A full example

The following is a working example defined in [test/mecks_unit_test.exs](https://github.com/archan937/mecks_unit/blob/master/test/mecks_unit_test.exs)

  ```elixir
  # (in test/test_helper.exs)

  ExUnit.start()
  MecksUnit.mock()
  ```

  ```elixir
  # (in test/mecks_unit_test.exs)

  defmodule Foo do
    def trim(string) do
      String.trim(string)
    end
  end

  defmodule MecksUnitTest do
    use ExUnit.Case, async: true
    use MecksUnit.Case

    defmock String do
      def trim("  Paul  "), do: "Engel"
      def trim("  Foo  ", "!"), do: "Bar"
      def trim(_, "!"), do: {:passthrough, ["  Surprise!  !!!!", "!"]}
      def trim(_, _), do: :passthrough
    end

    defmock List do
      def wrap(:foo), do: [1, 2, 3, 4]
    end

    mocked_test "using mocked module functions" do
      task =
        Task.async(fn ->
          assert "Engel" == String.trim("  Paul  ")
          assert "Engel" == Foo.trim("  Paul  ")
          assert "Bar" == String.trim("  Foo  ", "!")
          assert "  Surprise!  " == String.trim("  Paul  ", "!")
          assert "MecksUnit" == String.trim("  MecksUnit  ")
          assert "Paul Engel" == String.trim("  Paul Engel  ", " ")
          assert [1, 2, 3, 4] == List.wrap(:foo)
          assert [] == List.wrap(nil)
          assert [:bar] == List.wrap(:bar)
          assert [:foo, :bar] == List.wrap([:foo, :bar])
          assert called List.wrap(:foo)
          assert_called String.trim(_)
        end)

      Task.await(task)
    end

    test "using the original module functions" do
      task =
        Task.async(fn ->
          assert "Paul" == String.trim("  Paul  ")
          assert "Paul" == Foo.trim("  Paul  ")
          assert "  Foo  " == String.trim("  Foo  ", "!")
          assert "  Paul  " == String.trim("  Paul  ", "!")
          assert "MecksUnit" == String.trim("  MecksUnit  ")
          assert "Paul Engel" == String.trim("  Paul Engel  ", " ")
          assert [:foo] == List.wrap(:foo)
          assert [] == List.wrap(nil)
          assert [:bar] == List.wrap(:bar)
          assert [:foo, :bar] == List.wrap([:foo, :bar])
        end)

      Task.await(task)
    end
  end
  ```

Please note that you can delegate to the original implementation by either returning `:passthrough` (which forwards the given arguments)
or return a tuple `{:passthrough, arguments}` in which you can alter the arguments yourself.

## Asynchronous testing

Unlike [Mock](https://github.com/jjh42/mock), MecksUnit supports running mocked tests asynchronously. W00t! ^^
